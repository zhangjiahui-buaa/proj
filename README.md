## Overview

*Databases* directory contains all the databases, the corresponding logs and sql queries are in *logs* directory. There are 16 databases and corresponding log files, each of them can trigger a logic bugs in SQLite 3.40.0

In order to run them on SQLite 3.31.1 and find out how many of them are related to regression, you need to first install SQLite 3.31.1 and feed the data to it.

```bash
conda create -n older sqlite=3.31.1
conda activate older
python test.py --dbs_path databases --queries_path logs
```

## An example of regression logic bug in SQLite 3.40.0
### db: testcases/database0.db (randomly generated by sqlancer)

### queries that trigger logical bug (TLP by sqlancer)
The following two queries should give the same result. It's true in sqlite3.31.1 but not sqlite3.40.0
```sql
SELECT t0.c2 FROM t0 GROUP BY t0.c2;

SELECT ALL t0.c2 FROM t0 GROUP BY t0.c2 HAVING ((((((COUNT(t0.c1)) NOT NULL))AND(((t0.c0) BETWEE(t0.c0) AND (t0.c2)))))AND(t0.c2)) 
UNION ALL 
SELECT ALL t0.c2 FROM t0 GROUP BY t0.c2 HAVING (NOT (((((((COUNT(t0.c1)) NOT NULL))AND(((t0.c0) BETWEEN (t0.c0) AND (t0.c2)))))AND(t0.c2)))) 
UNION ALL 
SELECT ALL t0.c2 FROM t0 GROUP BY t0.c2 HAVING ((((((((COUNT(t0.c1)) NOT NULL))AND(((t0.c0) BETWEEN (t0.c0) AND (t0.c2)))))AND(t0.c2))) ISNULL); 
```

### Reproduce the bug
Basically you need two version of sqlite on your computer.
I use conda to do this.
First create an environment with sqlite3.40.0, then run the abovementioned testcase. The first query returns 0.202107171794723 and 522035749 but second one only returns 0.202107171794723 
```bash
conda create -n newer sqlite=3.40.0
conda activate newer
sqlite3 testcases/database0.db < testcases/database0.sql
```

Then create an environment with sqlite3.31.1, then run the abovementioned testcase. The two queries both return 522035749 and 0.202107171794723
```bash
conda create -n older sqlite=3.31.1
conda activate older
sqlite3 testcases/database0.db < testcases/database0.sql
``` 
Note that sometimes even if you activate a new environment, the shell would still invoke the old version of sqlite3. Make sure to kill and restart the shell several times to invoke the right version of sqlite3.
